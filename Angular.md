b. **Angular CLI** - This is a command line interface that we use to create new angular applications, generate some boiler code as well as create deployable packages.
To be able to install the Angular CLI, we use the comman:
_npm install -g @angular/cli@latest_
This will install the latest Angular CLI globally on your machine.
To approve the CLI has successfully been installed, we run the command
_ng version_
